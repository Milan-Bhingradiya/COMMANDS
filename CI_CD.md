# CI/CD - Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

## What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that automates code integration, testing, and deployment to production environments.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. **Source** - Code is pushed to a version control system (Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. **Build** - Compile the code and resolve dependencies.
3. **Test** - Run unit tests, integration tests, and security checks.
4. **Deploy** - Automatically deploy the application to production or staging environments.
5. **Monitor** - Observe logs, performance, and errors post-deployment.

## Popular CI/CD Tools
- **Jenkins** - Open-source automation server.
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD integrated with GitHub.
- **GitLab CI/CD** - Built-in CI/CD for GitLab.
- **CircleCI** - Cloud-based CI/CD service.
- **Travis CI** - Continuous integration for open-source projects.
- **Azure DevOps** - CI/CD by Microsoft.
- **AWS CodePipeline** - AWS-native CI/CD solution.
- **Bitbucket Pipelines** - CI/CD for Bitbucket repositories.

## Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab and click **New Workflow**.
3. Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file.

### Step 2: Define a Workflow YAML File

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push Changes
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will now trigger the pipeline on each push.

---

## CI/CD Best Practices
- Use **branching strategies** like Git Flow to manage releases.
- Automate **testing** to prevent regressions.
- Use **secrets management** for credentials (GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Monitor builds with logging tools (Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic).
- Implement **rollback mechanisms** in case of failures.
- Secure your pipeline with **access control** and **audit logging**.

## Deploying with Docker and Kubernetes

### Docker-Based CI/CD
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build Docker Image
    run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
  
  - name: Push to Docker Hub
    run: docker push myapp:latest
  
  - name: Deploy Container
    run: docker run -d -p 80:80 myapp:latest
```

### Kubernetes-Based CI/CD
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Apply Kubernetes Deployment
    run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

---

## Conclusion
CI/CD streamlines software development by automating testing and deployment. Tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI/CD make it easy to integrate best practices for faster, reliable releases.
